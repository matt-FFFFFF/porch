## ÔøΩ Configuration Schema

### Root Configuration

Every porch workflow starts with a root configuration that defines the overall structure:

```yaml
name: "Workflow Name"                    # Required: Descriptive name for the workflow
description: "Workflow description"      # Optional: Description of what this workflow does
commands: []                             # Required: List of commands to execute
command_groups: []                       # Optional: Named groups of commands for reuse
```

### Command Groups

Command groups allow you to define reusable sets of commands that can be referenced by container commands:

```yaml
command_groups:
  - name: "test-group"
    description: "Common testing commands"
    commands:
      - type: "shell"
        name: "Unit Tests"
        command_line: "go test ./..."
      - type: "shell"
        name: "Integration Tests"
        command_line: "go test -tags=integration ./..."
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

porch supports five built-in command types for different execution patterns:

### 1. Shell Commands (`shell`)

Execute any shell command with full environment control and configurable exit code handling.

**Required Attributes:**

- `type: "shell"`
- `name`: Descriptive name for the command
- `command_line`: The shell command to execute

**Optional Attributes:**

- `working_directory`: Directory to execute the command in
- `env`: Environment variables as key-value pairs
- `runs_on_condition`: When to run (`success`, `error`, `always`, `exit-codes`)
- `runs_on_exit_codes`: Specific exit codes that trigger execution (used with `runs_on_condition: exit-codes`)
- `success_exit_codes`: Exit codes that indicate success (defaults to `[0]`)
- `skip_exit_codes`: Exit codes that skip remaining commands in the current batch

**Using Redirection:**

Porch captures stdout and stderr automatically, and will by default display stderr in the results if the step fails or returns a skippable exit code. Therefore you can use redirection to capture output. E.g. to output to stderr, use `command_line: "your_command 1>&2"`.

```yaml
command_line: |
  if [ -z  "$FOO" ]; then
  echo "FOO is not set. Skipping" 1>&2
  exit 99
fi
skip_exit_codes: [99]
```

**Example:**

```yaml
- type: "shell"
  name: "Build Go Application"
  command_line: "go build -ldflags='-s -w' -o dist/app ."
  working_directory: "/path/to/project"
  env:
    CGO_ENABLED: "0"
    GOOS: "linux"
    GOARCH: "amd64"
  success_exit_codes: [0]
  skip_exit_codes: [2]
  runs_on_condition: "success"
```

  name: "Test All Modules"
  working_directory: "./modules"
  mode: "parallel"
  depth: 1
  include_hidden: false
  working_directory_strategy: "item_relative"
  commands:
    - type: "shell"
      name: "Run Module Tests"
      command_line: "go test ./..."
    - type: "shell"
      name: "Check Module"
      command_line: "go mod verify"
```

### 6. Copy Current Working Directory to Temp (`copycwdtotemp`)

A specialized command for working in temporary directories. Copies the current working directory to a temporary location for isolated execution.

**Required Attributes:**

- `type: "copycwdtotemp"`
- `name`: Descriptive name for the command

**Optional Attributes:**

```

This command is particularly useful for:

- Testing builds without affecting the source directory
- Creating clean environments for packaging
- Isolating potentially destructive operations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Configuration Options

### Conditional Execution

All commands support conditional execution based on the results of previous commands:

```yaml
- type: "shell"
  name: "Cleanup on Error"
  command_line: "rm -rf temp_files"

        env:
          OPTIMIZATION: "O3"              # This command sees GLOBAL_VAR, BUILD_TYPE, and OPTIMIZATION
```

### Working Directory Management

Control execution context with flexible working directory options:

```yaml
- type: "shell"
  name: "Build in Subdirectory"
  command_line: "make build"
  working_directory: "./subproject"      # Relative to current directory

- type: "serial"
  name: "Build Multiple Projects"

## üé® Output and Results

### Pretty-Printed Output

porch automatically generates beautiful tree-structured output showing the execution hierarchy:

```text
‚úì Build and Test Workflow
  ‚úì Setup Environment (0ms)
  ‚úì Quality Checks (2.1s)
    ‚úì Run Tests (1.8s)
    ‚úì Run Linter (1.2s)
    ‚úó Security Scan (0.5s) - exit code 1
      stderr: gosec: 1 issue found
  ‚úì Build Process (1.5s)
    ‚úì Build for Linux (0.8s)
    ‚úì Build for macOS (0.7s)
```

## üö¶ Signal Handling

porch provides sophisticated signal handling for graceful shutdown:

**First Signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM)**: Initiates graceful shutdown

- Running commands receive the signal for cleanup
- No new commands are started
- Context remains active for cleanup operations

**Second Signal**: Forces immediate termination

- Context is cancelled
- All running processes are killed
- Execution stops immediately

This allows for proper cleanup and prevents data corruption during interruption.
