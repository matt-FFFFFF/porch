// Package tui provides a real-time Terminal User Interface (TUI) for monitoring
// command execution progress in the Porch orchestration tool. It displays a live
// tree view of executing commands with status indicators, progress updates, and
// the last output line from each running command.
//
// The TUI integrates with the progress event system to provide real-time updates
// as commands are executed, offering better visibility into complex workflows
// compared to traditional text-based output.
